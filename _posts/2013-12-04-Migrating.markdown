  The website is slowly shaping into the one I've always wanted to build: static(but also interactive),
  simple, and most importantly, easy to maintain. Because I have had enough with my previous website. Written
  from scratch surely gives me total control over the pages, but that wasn't exactly what I needed. Updating
  the website became a pain in the ass for me soon enough, and I just didn't bother to switch to a different
  way -- actually the right way of doing it.

  It first occurred to me that I could actually put my site on [github.io](http://github.io) and save a few
  bucks for coffee after visiting some really cool pages hosted on [github.io](http://github.io). Too bad
  I could not recovery those links from my memory :( But the good part is I knew what I wanted and I had just
  found it!

  There is not much to talk about for rest of the story: I simply went through the tutorial of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
  and started building my version 5 website, feeling excited!
